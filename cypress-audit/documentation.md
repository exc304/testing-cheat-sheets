Cypress audits provide a comprehensive way to test accessibility issues in your website or application. These audits use automated tests to identify accessibility issues, such as missing alt text on images, non-descriptive link text, and other issues that can affect users with disabilities.

Using Cypress audits for accessibility testing can help you identify issues early in the development process, before they become more difficult and expensive to fix. This can save you time and money in the long run and ensure that your website or application is accessible to as many users as possible.

Overall, incorporating Cypress audits into your accessibility testing process is a powerful tool that you should use to ensure that your website or application is accessible to everyone. By doing so, you can improve the user experience for all users, avoid potential legal issues, and save time and money in the long run.

The idea behind `@cypress-audit/*` is to aggregate all the underlying configurations behind dedicated Cypress custom commands (opens new window): you can benefit from your own custom commands and you can run cross-cutting verifications directly inside your tests.
